;; This layer adds to each Spec one field for each direct intrinsic refinement,
;; expressing refinement in terms of composition (the next layer down).
;;
;; Extrinsic refinements are not included because instances need to be created
;; even if extrinsic refinements fail. Therefore those refinement expressions
;; are substituted in place at the site of `refine-to` and `refines-to?` calls.
;; [this isn't right yet -- where to put bounds for these extrinsic refinements?]
;;
;; Transitive refinements are not included directly either. Imagine a chain of
;; intrinsic refinements A -> B -> C.  If transitives were included instances of
;; A would have fields for B and C, but A's B would not need a field for C
;; (since it would be covered by A's C).  However, an instance of B by itself
;; _would_ still need a field C, requiring multiple versions of spec B.  So
;; instead transitive refinements are lowered to nested levels of composition: A
;; with a field for refinement to B, and that B with a field for refinement to C.
;;
;; However, since we do not want to require users to know full refinement paths,
;; :$refines-to bounds contain all transitive refinements, both extrinsic and
;; intrinsic, at a single level per source instance.

;; TODO: extrinsic (inverted) refinements
;; TODO: guarded refinements
