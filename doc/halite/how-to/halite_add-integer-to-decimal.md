## Add an integer value to a decimal value

Consider you have an integer and a decimal value and you need to add them together.

Since the integer and decimal values are of different types they cannot be directly added together.

```clojure
(let [x 3
      y #d "2.2"]
  (+ y x))


;-- result --
[:throws "h-err/no-matching-signature 0-0 : No matching signature for '+'"]
```

It is first necessary to convert them to the same type of value. In this case the integer is converted into a decimal value by multiplying it by one in the target decimal type.

```clojure
(let [x 3]
  (* #d "1.0" x))


;-- result --
#d "3.0"
```

Now the numbers can be added together.

```clojure
(let [x 3
      y #d "2.2"]
  (+ y (* #d "1.0" x)))


;-- result --
#d "5.2"
```
